# I added a way to make it work with prettier

# This script will run prettier and ESLint to all staged files before a commit
# To make this work for you, first rename this file to pre-commit, then put this
# file in .git/hooks/ and make the file executable (eg. chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit)

# Ensures echo works with backslash escapes
shopt -s xpg_echo
